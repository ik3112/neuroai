    <!-- Short Mission -->
    <h1>NeuroAI.help</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>NeuroAI.help exists to surface and support AI tools that reduce friction and unlock potential for neurodivergent minds.</strong><br>
      We start with real-life challenges â€” like task paralysis, memory overwhelm, and writing blocks â€” and work backwards to find or build practical tools that actually help.<br>
      This isnâ€™t about fixing people. Itâ€™s about shaping AI that works <em>with</em> us, not against us.

    <!-- Full Story -->
    <h2>Why NeuroAI.help Exists</h2>
    <p>Like many neurodivergent people, Iâ€™ve spent years adapting to systems that werenâ€™t built for how my brain works. Iâ€™ve worked on a range of ventures â€” some large, some grassroots â€” but <strong>NeuroAI.help</strong> isnâ€™t about business. Itâ€™s about addressing a shared need Iâ€™ve felt firsthand and seen in others: the gap between how neurodivergent minds work and how most tools are built.</p>

    <p>Then I found something that shifted everything: AI that <em>adapts to me</em>.</p>

    <p>I was an early user of ChatGPT â€” and it was the first tool that felt like it actually <em>understood</em> the way I think. It didnâ€™t just make me faster. It made me feel less alone in how I solve problems, plan ideas, and make sense of complexity. More than that, it helped me translate my ideas into formats others could actually access â€” bridging a gap thatâ€™s often invisible but deeply felt.</p>

    <p>I was watching <em>Inside Our Dyslexic Minds</em> by Chris Packham. In one scene, a site manager was shown struggling to read the text on an architectâ€™s drawing â€” even though he instantly understood the drawing itself. The text and diagram were on the same page, but one was clear and the other was a stressful struggle. And it struck me: this wasnâ€™t a complex barrier â€” it was an easily fixable format issue.</p>

    <p>That moment hit hard. It wasnâ€™t about intelligence â€” it was about format.</p>

    <p>I knew then that many others could be helped and enabled â€” not by changing themselves or even the information, but by using AI as a tool to do the heavy lifting. In that architectâ€™s drawing, the site manager didnâ€™t need the text rewritten. He needed a way to access it without stress. Now, with AI, we can do just that â€” have the system read aloud, summarise, or rephrase in real time to match how someone naturally understands. That changes everything.</p>

    <p>From that moment on, I started exploring common problems faced by neurodivergent people â€” and surprisingly, many of the solutions werenâ€™t complex at all. In fact, they were often simple.</p>

    <blockquote><strong>AI can unlock real support for neurodivergent minds â€” if we shape it around what actually helps.</strong></blockquote>

    <h2>What Weâ€™re Starting With</h2>
    <p><strong>NeuroAI.help</strong> is here to shine a light on practical, human-centered AI tools â€” especially ones that support people with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ðŸ§  Task paralysis</li>
      <li>ðŸ§  Memory overwhelm</li>
      <li>ðŸ§  Writing blocks</li>
      <li>ðŸ§  Miscommunication</li>
      <li>ðŸ§  Processing differences</li>
      <li>ðŸ§  The invisible effort it takes just to <em>get through the day</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Weâ€™ll start by curating, testing, and sharing tools that <em>genuinely help</em> â€” with plain-language guidance and real-world use cases.</p>

    <p>Weâ€™re also building a community â€” a space to connect stories, strategies, and everyday tools that actually make a difference. NeuroAI.help will become the new home for the evolving <em>Dyslexic Business Thinking</em> newsletter. More importantly, we want it to be collaborative.</p>

    <p>Weâ€™d love to hear from you: What challenges have you solved using AI? What problems are you still facing? Your insights can shape where we go next â€” together.</p>

    <h2>Where Weâ€™re Going</h2>
    <p>This will grow. Over time, NeuroAI.help could become:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>resource hub</strong> for individuals, families, and workplaces</li>
      <li>A <strong>testing lab</strong> for neurodivergent-led AI experiments</li>
      <li>A <strong>product studio</strong> building tools by and for those of us who think differently</li>
      <li>A <strong>collaborative movement</strong> shaping more inclusive systems from the ground up</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Weâ€™ll skip the buzzwords (well, most of them). No empty promises â€” just real learning, including the mistakes we make along the way.</p>

    <p><strong>Because inclusion isnâ€™t about inspiration â€” itâ€™s about action.<br>
    And the future shouldnâ€™t just work <em>for</em> neurodivergent people.<br>
    It should be built <em>with</em> us.</strong></p>
