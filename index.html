    <h1>Welcome to NeuroAI.help</h1>

    <p><strong>NeuroAI.help is here to make life easier for people who think differently.</strong></p>

    <p>We look for smart and simple ways that AI can support everyday challenges like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Getting started with tasks</li>
      <li>Remembering things</li>
      <li>Putting thoughts into words</li>
      <li>Understanding instructions</li>
      <li>Managing overload and stress</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™ve spent years working around tools and systems that didnâ€™t match how my brain works. Then I found something different: AI that could help me shape my thoughts, stay focused, and explain things in a way that others understood.</p>

    <p>I remember watching a program called <em>Inside Our Dyslexic Minds</em>. There was a scene where a man could understand building plans easily by looking at the drawing. But he found the written text on the same page hard and stressful. That moment stuck with me. It showed how a small change in format can make a big difference.</p>

    <p>Now, AI can read things out loud, explain them in simpler language, or even turn text into speech. These arenâ€™t big, expensive solutions â€” theyâ€™re just smart ways to make life easier. Thatâ€™s what NeuroAI.help is about.</p>

    <blockquote>
      AI can help us not by changing who we are, but by supporting how we already think and work.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>What We're Doing</h2>
    <p>Weâ€™re building a helpful directory of AI tools. Every tool we share solves a real problem. Weâ€™ll explain what it does, how it helps, and who itâ€™s useful for â€” in plain, clear language.</p>

    <p>This site will also become the new home for the <em>Dyslexic Business Thinking</em> newsletter. More than that, we want to hear from <strong>you</strong>.</p>

    <p>What has helped you? What tools are you looking for? What gets in your way?</p>
